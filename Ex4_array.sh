# Exercice
# In this exercise, you will need to add numbers and strings to the correct arrays. You must add the numbers 1,2, and 3 to the "numbers" array, and the words 'hello' and 'world' to the strings array.
# You will also have to correct the values of the variable NumberOfNames and the variable second_name. NumberOfNames should hold the total number of names in the NAMES array, using the $# special variable. Variable second_name should hold the second name in the NAMES array, using the brackets operator [ ]. Note that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access the second item in the list, its index will be 1.

NAMES=( John Eric Jessica )
NUMBERS=( 1 2 3 )
STRINGS=( Hello world )
NumberOfNames=${#NAMES[@]}
second_name=${NAMES[1]}
echo ${NUMBERS[@]}
echo ${STRINGS[@]}
echo "The number of names listed in the NAMES array: $NumberOfNames"
echo "The second name on the NAMES list is:" ${second_name}
